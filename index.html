					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
						I’m a digital creator with a BSc (Hons) in Sound Engineering and Multimedia, specialising in learning technology. I design interactive, accessible learning activities that combine instructional design, UX (WCAG/PSBAR compliance), and audio/video production, working closely with subject matter experts to bring their ideas to life.
					</p>
					<p style="color: #fff;">
						I have spent the past decade working within the award-winning HELM team (Health e-Learning & Media) in the School of Health Sciences at The University of Nottingham, where I have collaborated with students, practitioners, and educators to co-create innovative digital learning solutions. I hold a PRINCE2 certification, enabling me to deliver complex projects efficiently and with precision, and I’m a Certified Member of Association of Learning Technologists (CMALT), demonstrating my ongoing commitment to professional practice in digital learning.

				<h2>Video Production</h2>
				<p>
					I have extensive experience in filming and editing educational videos that are integrated into interactive learning packages. These resources enhance student engagement, support multimodal learning, and provide flexible opportunities for knowledge acquisition, while aligning with accessibility best practice. Many resources are released under a Creative Commons licence for worldwide access.
				</p>
				<p>
					In line with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy's <a href="https://www.csp.org.uk/frontline/article/redefining-physiotherapy-education" target="_blank">Redefining Physiotherapy Education</a>, I collaborated on redesigning the Undergraduate Physiotherapy Curriculum. We developed six interactive, problem-based learning scenarios for 120+ first-year students, each starting with an engaging video stimulus and progressing to small-group discussions and interactive online activities. Feedback has been positive, with case studies revised based on student input.
				</p>
				<p>
					I also produce short-form “learning shorts” optimised for platforms such as YouTube and social media, applying microlearning principles for accessible, on-the-go content that complements longer resources.

       <h3>Virtual Placement</h3>

<p>
Students on a wide range of courses, particularly in healthcare, are required to complete placement learning. Placement learning supports specific learning outcomes and is a requirement for successful course completion at the University. However, placement experiences are becoming increasingly difficult to source and more expensive to resource. The pandemic posed a particular challenge, and availability has not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels. To address this, a bespoke "Virtual Placement" (VP) platform was designed to provide authentic, practice-oriented experiences. Students are introduced to their practice supervisor, Krish, who guides them along their learning journey, including virtual home visits to a patient, Lionel.
</p>

<p>
The VP platform applies experiential learning principles and incorporates feedback loops that replicate guidance from clinical mentors. Built using a robust technology stack - including PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, jQuery UI, Bootstrap, JSON, MySQL, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, OpenAI API, TinyMCE, Apache ECharts, and RSS - the platform delivers a rich, interactive, and secure virtual learning experience. It has been rolled out to four student cohorts (400+ users), with further development shaped by ongoing feedback. Accessibility audits using WAVE, axe DevTools, and Silktide plug-ins ensure compliance and usability for diverse learners.
</p>

<h3>ADHD Translation Resources</h3>

<p>
This project focused on equipping healthcare professionals and members of the public with accessible information on how to assess and recognise ADHD in both children and adults. The resources equip learners with an understanding of ADHD as well as the role of primary care professionals in its diagnosis and management and are endorsed by the Royal College of General Practitioners. 
</p>

<p>
These were split into two resources, <em>Understanding ADHD</em> and <em>The Role of the General Practitioner in ADHD Diagnosis and Management</em>, which were translated from English into French, Spanish, and German. This involved close collaboration with stakeholders and professional translators, as well as accessibility audits using WAVE, Silktide, and axe DevTools to ensure content is clear, inclusive, and usable for diverse audiences. The RLOs were technically created using HTML, CSS, PHP, and Java, combining educational content with interactive digital functionality to enhance learner engagement.
